# Control Flow Graph Simulator/Calculator

Welcome to the Control Flow Graph (CFG) Simulator/Calculator repository! This Java-based project is designed to provide a comprehensive toolset for analyzing and manipulating Control Flow Graphs, which are widely used in software testing and static code analysis. Whether you're a software engineer, a researcher, or a student, this tool offers a versatile platform for exploring the intricacies of code flow within your programs.

## Features:

Node Representation: Define nodes to represent individual code blocks within your program.
Edge Connection: Establish connections between nodes to represent flow paths.
Path Analysis: Calculate shortest, simple, and prime paths within the CFG.
Reachability Analysis: Determine if certain nodes are reachable from others.
Graph Splitting: Split the CFG into Single Entry Single Exit (SESE) graphs.
Custom Data Structures: Implement your own data structures for added flexibility and efficiency.
Getting Started:

## To use the CFG Simulator/Calculator, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Use git clone to clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile the Code: Compile the Java source code using javac.
Run the Program: Execute the main program using java.
Explore and Experiment: Interact with the program to create and analyze CFGs.
